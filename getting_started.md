# Getting Started

If you're interested in the following topics, this resource is for you!

   * A basic overview of Geodetic Datums
   * How do I compare my orthometric height data to an global elevation model that uses ellipsoid heights?
   * How do I use open source software (GDAL, PROJ, GeoPandas, Xarray) to reproject data to various coordinate reference systems
   * How to digest the alphabet soup of CRS abbreviations: NAD83, WGS84, GRS80, NAVD88, EGM, ITRF
   * Whatâ€™s Next for Geodetic Datums?


## When to look elsewhere

This guide focuses on *practical examples* of using open source software to perform coordinate transforms necessary to compare elevation measurements collected over time by different sensors. It does not delve into much theory, but does provide references throughout to more thorough references.

## Software libraries

Example code in this repository relies on the following open source libraries:

- GDAL [@cite_gdal]
- PROJ [@cite_proj]
- GeoPandas [@cite_geopandas]
- Xarray [@cite_xarray]
