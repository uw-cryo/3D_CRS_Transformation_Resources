:::{glossary}
datum
: the geometric relationship between a coordinate system grid and coordinates on the Earth's surface

ellipsoid
: idealized ellipsoidal geometry representing a best-fit surface through the Earth's topography (e.g. GRS90)

ensemble
: for datums like WGS that have many realizations, the 'ensemble' is the collection of all realizations. Data collected without specifying a realization consequently is *labeled as referenced to the ensemble* and has higher intrinsic uncertainty

epoch
: the timestamp of data collection

frame epoch
: date for which a set of coordinates within a datum are considered valid

geoid
: best-fit irregular equipotential surface that closely approximates global mean sea level

orthometric height
: Local elevation measured normal to *geoid* surface (rather than ellipsoid surface)

realization
: a specific datum definition consiting of origin, orientation, and scale of the coordinate system, usually determined empirically at a specific point in time
